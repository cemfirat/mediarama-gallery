# Metadata Format Support Matrix

Status: **initial ExifTool-backed policy**

| ORF/RW2/PEF/etc. | Yes where ExifTool supports | Sidecar/export preferred | No | RAW-safe |
| XMP sidecar | Yes | Yes | N/A | Canonical RAW companion |
| MP4/MOV | Yes | Later phase | No | Video metadata phase |
| MP3/audio | Yes where supported | Later phase | No | Audio metadata phase |

## Important limitation

"Writable" does not mean every metadata family is valid in every file type.

For example, a container may support XMP but not legacy IPTC IIM, or may permit writing an existing profile but not creating one.

Therefore the exporter must use **capability-based writing** rather than blindly copying every tag group.

## Priority order

For canonical descriptive metadata, prefer modern interoperable namespaces:

1. XMP/IPTC Photo Metadata fields where appropriate;
2. EXIF for camera/technical fields;
3. legacy IPTC IIM only where format/tool compatibility justifies it.

Mediarama's database remains the canonical editable layer regardless of how a particular export file can encode those fields.
